\begin{exercises}

\ex{2.5.1}
For each of the following functions find those values
of $x$ for which $f(x)$ or $f^\prime(x)$ vanish and
use them to verify Rolle's Theorem.
\begin{exenum}
\sx
$f(x) = x^2 - 7x - 8$
\sx
$f(x) = 12x - x^3$
\sx
$f(x) = (x+4)(x+1)(x-2)$
\sx
$f(x) = x^2(x^2 - 16)$
\sx
$f(x) = x - \frac4x$
\sx
$f(x) = (9 - x^2)^2$.
\end{exenum}

\ex{2.5.2}
For each of the following functions and the specified
values of $a$ and $b$, find a number $c$ such that
$a<c<b$ and $f(b) = f(a) + (b-a)f^\prime(c)$.
\begin{exenum}
\sx
$f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 5, a = 1, b = 4$
\sx
$f(x) = x^3, a=0, b=1$
\sx
$f(x) = -\frac1x, a=1, b=3$
\sx
$f(x) = \frac8{x^2}, a=1, b=2$.
\end{exenum}

\ex{2.5.3}
Consider the function $f(x) = 1 - |x|$ defined on the closed interval
from $-1$ to $1$.  Which hypotheses of Rolle's Theorem
does this function satisfy and which does it not satisfy?
Does this function satisfy the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem?

\ex{2.5.4}
Consider the function $f$ defined on the closed interval
$[4,7]$ by
\[
\dilemma{f(x)=0, & x=4,}{f(x)=7-x, & 4 < x \leq 7.}
\]
Show where this function fails to satisfy the conditions of
Rolle's Theorem, and that is does not satisfy the conclusion.

\ex{2.5.5}
For each of the following functions $f$, find the set of all
functions with derivative equal to $f$.
\begin{exenum}
\sx
$f(x) = 4x$
\sx
$f(x) = 4x^3 + x^2 + 2$
\sx
$f(x) = \frac1{x^2}$
\sx
$f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x^2 + 1)^3}$.
\end{exenum}

\ex{2.5.6}
Prove that, if on an automobile trip the average velocity
was $45$ miles per hour, then at some instant during the
trip the speedometer registered precisely $45$.
